# Snake
*Ik it's a basic name but that is literally all it is*
## Why did I make it?
- This was for the Lonestar College Computer Science Club as both an example of what can be made using pygame.
- Also, the `basic_snake.py` file would be example for the club if they were to attempt to make their own snake game.
